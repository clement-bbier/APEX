## Session 001 — 2026-04-11

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-04-11 |
| Mission | Phase 3 design specification gate (#61) |
| Agent Model | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| Duration | ~2 hours |

### Decisions Made

1. Phase 3 decomposed into 13 atomic sub-phases (3.1--3.13)
2. Custom lightweight Feature Store preferred over Feast
3. CPCV with purging as mandatory cross-validation (ADR-0002 compliance)
4. vectorbt PRO deferred to Phase 5 (not needed for IC validation)
5. 2 P0 managed agents ($3-7/month), 2 P1 agents (may exceed budget)

### Files Created/Modified

- `docs/phases/PHASE_3_SPEC.md` (created) — complete Phase 3 specification
- `docs/claude_memory/` (created) — persistent memory system (6 files)
- `CLAUDE.md` (modified) — added persistent memory section
- `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` (modified) — Phase 3 section updated
- `MANAGED_AGENTS_PLAYBOOK.md` (modified) — 4 Phase 3 agents added

### Key Findings

- S07 functions (HAR-RV, rough vol, microstructure) are PURE and ready for Phase 3 consumption
- S02 signal pipeline uses weighted confluence (5 components); Phase 3 features will become additional components
- All 6 candidate features (HAR-RV, Rough Vol, OFI, CVD, Kyle lambda, GEX) already have scaffolding in S02/S07
- GEX validation is high-risk due to options data availability

### Next Steps

- Begin Phase 3.1 (Feature Engineering Pipeline Foundation)
- Deploy apex-paper-watcher and apex-codebase-analyzer managed agents
- Address P1 audit issues (#64-#77) in parallel

## Session 002 — 2026-04-11

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-04-11 |
| Mission | Sprint 1 — Docs quick wins (#67, #78, #79, #80) |
| Agent Model | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| Duration | ~1 hour |

### Decisions Made

1. Created centralized GLOSSARY.md with 46 terms across 8 categories
2. Adopted Conventional Commits convention for APEX (docs/CONVENTIONS/COMMIT_MESSAGES.md)
3. Refreshed PROJECT_ROADMAP.md to ground truth (Phase 2 sub-phases 2.7-2.12 DONE, appendices updated, ADR index expanded, risks R17-R19 added)
4. Added commit conventions as CLAUDE.md Section 12 (binding on all future Claude Code sessions)

### Files Created/Modified

- `docs/GLOSSARY.md` (created) — 46 terms, 8 categories, academic references
- `docs/CONVENTIONS/COMMIT_MESSAGES.md` (created) — Conventional Commits for APEX
- `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` (modified) — Phase 2 sub-phases DONE, open questions resolved, Appendix A corrected, ADR index expanded (0004-0015), risks R17-R19, governance P0 items closed
- `CLAUDE.md` (modified) — Section 12 commit conventions added
- `docs/claude_memory/SESSIONS.md` (modified) — this entry

### Key Findings

- PROJECT_ROADMAP had 15+ stale entries (IN PROGRESS/PENDING for completed work)
- Appendix A data coverage tables were inconsistent with Phase 2 completion state
- ADR index was missing 8 ADRs proposed by Phase 3 spec and meta-governance audit
- Existing glossary in Appendix C of ROADMAP was minimal (only acronym expansions, no definitions)

### Next Steps

- Begin Phase 3.1 (Feature Engineering Pipeline Foundation)
- Continue Sprint 2 docs: ARCHITECTURE.md (#82), ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md (#83), ONBOARDING.md (#84)
- Address P1 audit issues (#64-#77) in parallel with Phase 3
